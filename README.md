If you somehow found this code for the class, don't use it. The final versions are not uploaded.

Also, some of this code is very panicked "why isn't this wOrKIng????" desperate throwing of code at a wall until something works but instead of it working it breaks more...so keep that in mind. Also, you would make KC sad. Do you want to make him sad?
